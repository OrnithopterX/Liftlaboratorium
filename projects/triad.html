        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          The Triad is an experimental Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft. In simple terms, this means it
          can hover like a helicopter and also transition into forward flight like a plane.
          Control is achieved with three thrust-vectoring flaps arranged around a central thrust axis. These flaps
          redirect the thrust to control pitch, roll, and yaw. In forward flight, the Triad uses three symmetrically
          placed wings to generate lift. This configuration ensures balanced lift across the roll axis at all times
          regardless of the aircraft’s orientation. As a result, the aircraft can sustain flight along any point along
          the thrust line. These sets of three, the flaps and wings, are what give the project its name: Triad, meaning
          a group of three elements.
          See below for a flight demonstration.

        <p>
          3D design of the lastest version of the Triad Project. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The Triad is not a forgiving platform. Still, the system began to work after I learned a few key lessons. One
          challenge
          was that I developed everything in parallel—airframe, controls, electronics, software and tuning—without
          knowing if any
          individual part was fully functional. Most of the time, I could only tell which parts weren’t behaving as
          expected; I
          was never completely sure what was working.
          The following sections outline the major challenges I encountered and what I learned throughout the project.
        </p>

        <strong>Design goals</strong>
        <p>
          With the Triad, my goal was to build a kinematically efficient VTOL aircraft. I wanted every motor and
          actuator to
          contribute meaningfully in both hover and forward flight, avoiding idle components in either mode.
          The aircraft was designed so that each degree of freedom—pitch, roll, yaw, and linear movement along the
          thrust
          axis—would have a corresponding actuator. This reduces the cost and weight of the finished aircraft.
          I also wanted the Triad to support omni-axis flight around its thrust vector—flying upright, inverted,
          sideways, or in
          any orientation in between.
        </p>

        <strong>Mixing</strong>
        <p>
          Control mixing was one of the first challenges to solve. In this configuration, only the central motor
          responds directly
          to linear input. All other controls are handled via a custom mixing matrix, which maps flight inputs (pitch,
          roll, yaw)
          to actuator outputs. I wrote custom scripts to define and tune these mappings, allowing the Triad to achieve
          stable
          hover and controlled transitions.
          Unlike many other VTOL platforms, like the quad plane, there is no transition state. This means the mixing
          script does
          not change in forward flight or hover, only the angle of attack changes to achieve a different flight format.
        </p>

        <strong>Aircraft layout</strong>
        <p>
          Balancing stability, control authority, and simplicity proved especially difficult for a first-time layout.
          Multiple
          iterations were required to find a geometry that supported both hover and forward flight without excessive
          structural
          complexity.
        </p>

        <strong>Wings and flaps</strong>
        <p>
          Correctly sizing the wings and flaps was essential to building a flyable aircraft. I tested a variety of
          configurations
          in simulation and in real-world flight to find a balance between lift, responsiveness, and stability.
        </p>

        <strong>Vibration Reduction</strong>
        <p>
          In-flight vibration was the most persistent issue. As I reduced weight and increased control-loop tuning
          rates, the
          airframe became more sensitive to mechanical vibration and feedback-loop instability.
          By version 3.3, I introduced foam board supports to stiffen the structure. In version 4.0, I redesigned the
          frame with carbon fiber tubes for increased stiffness and reduced flex.
          Other improvements included:
          <li> Reinforcing foamboard wings with embedded carbon rods </li>
          <li> Replacing flap linkages with a direct-drive system to eliminate mechanical backlash </li>
          <li> Designing triangular landing gear to reduce ground-induced vibration and prevent yaw I-term buildup
            before takeoff </li>
        </p>



        <strong>Center of prussure for wings</strong>
        <p>
          Early versions of the Triad (up to v3.3) failed to maintain heading in forward flight. The aircraft would
          pitch forward
          or backward but wouldn’t stay on course.
          Upon reviewing flight footage, I realized the aircraft was weathervaning—rotating to align with the direction
          of airflow, either from wind or its own motion. The root issue was that the center of pressure did not align with
          the center of gravity.
          To correct this, I modeled one-third of the aircraft (a wing + flap section) in CAD and calculated the center
          of gravity
          of the resulting 2D shape. This gave a close approximation of the aircraft’s center of pressure, which I then
          aligned
          with the CG along the Z-axis.
        </p>

        <strong>Possible future improvments</strong>
        <p>
          If I were to redesign the Triad, I would keep the core configuration but improve the airframe’s stiffness and
          efficiency. Here are a few areas of potential improvement:
          
          <li>
            <b>Flap stall reduction - </b>
            The flaps tend to stall during rapid descent. Increasing flap area, reducing overall weight, or even
            increasing the number of flaps could improve control and stall resistance.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Structural optimization - </b>
            A fully carbon fiber tube structure would reduce torsional flexing and allow for more aggressive control
            tuning.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Vibration mitigation - </b>
            Continued refinement of the frame could reduce noise and instability from vibration-sensitive PID loops.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Propeller disk loading - </b>
            A larger-diameter propeller would reduce disk loading, leading to quieter operation, longer flight times,
            and a larger
            flight envelope. Propeller counter-torque could also be reduced with better blade and motor matching.
          </li>
        </p>

        <h2>Update Log</h2>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 4.3</h3>
          <p> 
            The latest version of the Traid project. In order to reduce the propeller disk loading, I removed a lot of weight and used a smaller 6 cell li-po battery. 
            This improved flight proformance, but there was still a lot to be desired. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 4.2</h3>
          <p> Fitted with larger flaps this version flew much better than the last</p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 4.1</h3>
          <p> 
            Version 4.1 was the first airframe of the 4th of the Triad series. To start things off I didn't like the foamboard structure of the past airframe’s
            - they proved to dent and fold in a "hard, unplanned landing" far too well. Also the landing gear and servo linkages produced vibrations in flight and 
            contributed to the I-term spoolup issue when landed. To fix these issues, I deleted the enitre cad workspace from the past design to force myself to think 
            outside of the box on this design and use everything I have learned on the past versions.(I have a habit of shareing parts when I can, so the motor mount 
            on version 3.4 was unchanged from version 1.0! I actually used the same printed part!) Starting off, I designed a carbon fiber frame to attach the flaps 
            and wings to, and attached the flaps directly to the servos. I also updated the landing gear to include two carbon rods that attach at the tip - this practially 
            constrains the possible deformation to only the z-axis, which is helpful for softer landings. The design worked almost perfectly, however, there wasn't a lot of 
            yaw athority. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 4.0</h3>
          <p>
            Never built. This version looked a lot like version 3.4 but with a GPS mount, triangle landing gear, and an FPV camera! 
            It was never built because I rethought the flap system to remove the linkages entirely - 
            and this idea moved into every other part of the design until I deleted the CAD document and started from fresh! 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 3.4</h3>
          <p>
            Watching video of high alpha flights I conducted on version 3.3, I made an important discovery: the airframe was "weathervane-ing" - 
            this occurs when the airframe moves towards the wind like a weathervane! After some thought, I found the solution, add some area above the center of 
            gravity to balance the twisting moments out. Version 3.3 was out of balance by a factor of over 12 to 1 - there was 12 times the force acting on the 
            lower half of the airframe, rotating towards the wind! Version 3.4 was out of balance by a factor of 2.048/1! That was the trick, the aircraft flew much 
            better after the wing area was changed! 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 3.3</h3>
          <p>
            Building off of the past version, I needed to reduce the vibrations in the airframe. I added some foam board panels to brace the wings - 
            this worked, but I soon discovered the vibrations were also propagating from the landing gear.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 3.2</h3>
          <p>
            This version had one thing in mind for its design: vibration reduction! Carbon fiber tubes were added to the wings to stiffen things up,
            and nylon string was routed across the wings in an attempt to brace deflections - nothing worked. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 3.1</h3>
          <p>
            The first real version of the 3 series, it flew, but the flights were constrained to tethered runs. A lot of tuning made to system flyable,
            but it was very far from self-sustaining. 
            Also, vibrations make to airframe nearly untunable, which delayed any hopes of an untethered flight any time soon.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 3.0</h3>
          <p> 
            Only existed in CAD, I bet you can see a pattern going on here. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 2.2</h3>
          <p> 
              At the loss of V2.1, I replaced the servo and cut some of the foam out to allow a larger propeller. 
              It flew slightly better than V2.1, but not by much at all, in fact, even V1.2 flew better! 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 2.1</h3>
          <p> 
            This version did fly, but only once! Upon the maiden, the aircraft was largely uncontrollably,
            I disarmed and the Triad crashed into the ground, destroying one of the wing servos. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 2.0</h3>
          <p>
            Yet again, this version only existed in CAD, the reason was the flap hinges were too hard to build in reality. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 1.2</h3>
          <p> 
            The same day V1.1 was build, I cut some material from the airframe to allow for larger flaps, something that was desperately needed.
            The results were largely improved. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 1.1</h3>
          <p> 
            This version was built and flew, to a degree. There were a massive number of issues, from mixing misassignment to tiny flaps, 
            this version had it all! It barely flew at all, but it was the glimmer of hope I needed. The project was in motion now! 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <h3>Version 1.0</h3>
          <p> 
            Triad V1.0 (at the time known as the triwing) only existed in CAD. The airframe was too difficult to manufacture, so the version was reworked.
