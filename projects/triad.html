        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          The Triad is an experimental Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft. In simple terms, this means it
          can hover like a helicopter and also transition into forward flight like a plane.
          Control is achieved with three thrust-vectoring flaps arranged around a central thrust axis. These flaps
          redirect the thrust to control pitch, roll, and yaw. In forward flight, the Triad uses three symmetrically
          placed wings to generate lift. This configuration ensures balanced lift across the roll axis at all times
          regardless of the aircraft’s orientation. As a result, the aircraft can sustain flight along any point along
          the thrust line. These sets of three, the flaps and wings, are what give the project its name: Triad, meaning
          a group of three elements.
          See below for a flight demonstration.

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          The Triad is not a forgiving platform. Still, the system began to work after I learned a few key lessons. One
          challenge
          was that I developed everything in parallel—airframe, controls, electronics, software and tuning—without
          knowing if any
          individual part was fully functional. Most of the time, I could only tell which parts weren’t behaving as
          expected; I
          was never completely sure what was working.
          The following sections outline the major challenges I encountered and what I learned throughout the project.
        </p>

        <strong>Design goals</strong>
        <p>
          With the Triad, my goal was to build a kinematically efficient VTOL aircraft. I wanted every motor and
          actuator to
          contribute meaningfully in both hover and forward flight, avoiding idle components in either mode.
          The aircraft was designed so that each degree of freedom—pitch, roll, yaw, and linear movement along the
          thrust
          axis—would have a corresponding actuator. This reduces the cost and weight of the finished aircraft.
          I also wanted the Triad to support omni-axis flight around its thrust vector—flying upright, inverted,
          sideways, or in
          any orientation in between.
        </p>

        <strong>Mixing</strong>
        <p>
          Control mixing was one of the first challenges to solve. In this configuration, only the central motor
          responds directly
          to linear input. All other controls are handled via a custom mixing matrix, which maps flight inputs (pitch,
          roll, yaw)
          to actuator outputs. I wrote custom scripts to define and tune these mappings, allowing the Triad to achieve
          stable
          hover and controlled transitions.
          Unlike many other VTOL platforms, like the quad plane, there is no transition state. This means the mixing
          script does
          not change in forward flight or hover, only the angle of attack changes to achieve a different flight format.
        </p>

        <strong>Aircraft layout</strong>
        <p>
          Balancing stability, control authority, and simplicity proved especially difficult for a first-time layout.
          Multiple
          iterations were required to find a geometry that supported both hover and forward flight without excessive
          structural
          complexity.
        </p>

        <strong>Wings and flaps</strong>
        <p>
          Correctly sizing the wings and flaps was essential to building a flyable aircraft. I tested a variety of
          configurations
          in simulation and in real-world flight to find a balance between lift, responsiveness, and stability.
        </p>

        <strong>Vibration Reduction</strong>
        <p>
          In-flight vibration was the most persistent issue. As I reduced weight and increased control-loop tuning
          rates, the
          airframe became more sensitive to mechanical vibration and feedback-loop instability.
          By version 3.3, I introduced foam board supports to stiffen the structure. In version 4.0, I redesigned the
          frame with
          carbon fiber tubes for increased stiffness and reduced flex.
          Other improvements included:
          <li> Reinforcing foamboard wings with embedded carbon rods </li>
          <li> Replacing flap linkages with a direct-drive system to eliminate mechanical backlash </li>
          <li> Designing triangular landing gear to reduce ground-induced vibration and prevent yaw I-term buildup
            before takeoff </li>
        </p>



        <strong>Center of prussure for wings</strong>
        <p>
          Early versions of the Triad (up to v3.3) failed to maintain heading in forward flight. The aircraft would
          pitch forward
          or backward but wouldn’t stay on course.
          Upon reviewing flight footage, I realized the aircraft was weathervaning—rotating to align with the direction
          of
          airflow, either from wind or its own motion. The root issue was that the center of pressure did not align with
          the
          center of gravity.
          To correct this, I modeled one-third of the aircraft (a wing + flap section) in CAD and calculated the center
          of gravity
          of the resulting 2D shape. This gave a close approximation of the aircraft’s center of pressure, which I then
          aligned
          with the CG along the Z-axis.
        </p>

        <strong>Possible future improvments</strong>
        <p>
          If I were to redesign the Triad, I would keep the core configuration but improve the airframe’s stiffness and
          efficiency. Here are a few areas of potential improvement:
          Flap stall reduction
          The flaps tend to stall during rapid descent. Increasing flap area, reducing overall weight, or even
          increasing the
          number of flaps could improve control and stall resistance.


          <li>
            <b>Structural optimization - </b>
            A fully carbon fiber tube structure would reduce torsional flexing and allow for more aggressive control
            tuning.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Vibration mitigation - </b>
            Continued refinement of the frame could reduce noise and instability from vibration-sensitive PID loops.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Propeller disk loading - </b>
            A larger-diameter propeller would reduce disk loading, leading to quieter operation, longer flight times,
            and a larger
            flight envelope. Propeller counter-torque could also be reduced with better blade and motor matching.
          </li>
        </p>
