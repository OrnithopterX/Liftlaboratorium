            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I’m Joshua Adcock, an Electrical Engineering student with a passion for hands-on learning through complex projects. 
                This site is a living collection of the experiments and systems I’ve designed to explore flight, control, simulation, computer science and 
                anything else I happen to find interest in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am working on getting the site structure the way I like it, this means I am doing a lot of work behind-the-scenes. 
                However, I will soon start publishing and refining the project pages for my scratch-build lidar, the Triad project, the Levo simulator, 
                and the DragonFlight project, with many more to come! If any of this interests you, bookmark this page and come back in a few days. 
                Until then, If you have suggestions for future projects, improvements on existing projects, requests for more information, 
                or would simply like to say hello, feel free to reach me directly through the contact page.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Again, this site is work in progress, thanks for following along as this site continues to improve!
            </p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Lift Laboratorium is home to my personal research projects that are focused on UAV development, experimental aircraft, robotics, 
                autonomous systems, embedded electronics, and simulation software. Projects here highlight engineering, design, software development, 
                and hands-on learning in flight systems and creative technology.
